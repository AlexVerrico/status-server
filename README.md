# Status Server

A lightweight centralised logging and status monitor server  
This component is just the server-side logic to store all the data and provide a method to access it.  
I am currently working on various client scripts, however as none of these are finished yet, the best way to interact with the API currently is to write your own scripts using either CURL or Python Requests (or any other program capable of making HTTP requests).  

## Warning: I make no guaruntees that this program is secure or suitable for production use. It is not yet to the stage where I would call it "finished"

## Setup
Download and extract the latest release     
install the python requirements (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)  
Run the setup script `python initial_setup.py`  
run the program `python main.py`
